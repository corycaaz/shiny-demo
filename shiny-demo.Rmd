# Shiny Basics
___
Two parts to every Shiny app: a web page that shows the app and a server. Necessary to write the *user interface* and *server*. The *UI* shows the user visuals and possible options while the *server* display nothing. Rather, it is the underlying logic.

Navigate to the `demo_app` folder to see an example of an empty `app.R`, the file that initializes the Shiny app.

If the app is complex, it is possible to define it as two separate files: `ui.R` and `server.R`. These have to be in the same folder, but cannot be in a folder with `app.R`.

## Build the Basic UI
___
Add character strings to add text to a Shiny app.

Format text with functions named after HTML tags, such as `h1()`, `a()`, and `strong()`. It is possible to add style with something like `div("this is blue", style = "color: blue;")`.

Shiny comes with a special, improved version of h1 tags called `titlePanel()`.

Specify layout with `sidebarLayout()`. To see the HTML structure, simply `print(ui)`.

### Shiny Inputs & Outputs
___
In order for a user to interact with the server, inputs are necessary.

![Types of Shiny Inputs](shiny-inputs.png)

All inputs have two main arguments:

1. `inputId` = must be unique; allows the shiny server to interact with the UI
2. `label` = the text associated with the input

Outputs also must match by `outputId`, which must be unique.

# Server Logic = Outputs
___
In a single script app, the `server` variable listens to input changes. The `server()` requires two arguments: `input` and `output`. These mandatory arguments are lists.

For example, to render a plot in the `mainPanel()`, use ggplot2 code within `renderPlot()`.
